# Do it For All of Us

Let's make the most starred repo. Do it for me. Do it for you. Do it for
all of us.

## How can I get in on this?
Participating is easy with our patented 4 step process:

 * star the
   repo
 * [add your name to the end of the
   README](https://github.com/smholloway/do-it-for-all-of-us/edit/master/README.md)
 * open a [pull
   request](https://github.com/smholloway/do-it-for-all-of-us/pulls), and
I will accept it
 * profit

### Caveats
Be a decent human, please. Don't be a jerk. Don't post copywritten
materials. Don't post slurs or offensive images.
