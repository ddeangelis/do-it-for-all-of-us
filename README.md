# Do it For All of Us

Let's make the most starred repo. Do it for me. Do it for you. [Do it for
all of us](http://doitforallof.us/).

## How can I get in on this?
Participating is easy with our simple 4 step process:

 * star the repo
 * [add your name to the end of the README](https://github.com/smholloway/do-it-for-all-of-us/edit/master/README.md)
 * open a [pull request](https://github.com/smholloway/do-it-for-all-of-us/pulls), and I will accept it
 * profit

### Caveats
Let's do something epic together. Participating here should be fun and
respectful. So I ask you to please be decent. Don't be a jerk. Don't
spam (if your name is `gold rolex watches cheap` I may ask for a copy of
your driver's license). Don't post copywritten materials. Don't post
slurs or offensive images. Don't make me reject pull requests.

Thanks!
